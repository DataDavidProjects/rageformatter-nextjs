          <strong>How optimized is the model?</strong>
          <p>
            While the model is functional, it{`'`}s still being optimized. If it
            doesn{`'`}t provide the desired output, feel free to try again!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why isn{`'`}t it working sometimes?</strong>
          <p>
            There{`'`}s a set limit for the number of requests to ensure smooth
            operation. If it{`'`}s not working, you might have reached that
            limit. Just try again later or consider helping us with a donation
            to keep the app running.

          <strong>Any guidelines for using RageFormatter?</strong>
          <p>
            For best results, provide a clear context. The model needs a working
            situation to analyze, not just random words. Define subjects and
            situations adequately.
