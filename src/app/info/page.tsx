            <strong>Do you save my messages or data?</strong>
            <p>
              Absolutely No! RageFormatter do not store any data and is
              completeley anonymus. Your messages however might be part of
              OpenAI collections but never connected directley to you.
              Rageformatter is safe and built with no commercal intensions.

            <strong>How optimized is the model?</strong>
            <p>
              While the model is functional, it's still being optimized. If it
              doesn't provide the desired output, feel free to try again! If the
              answer is truncated is because you have reached a pre defined
              token limit for your answer. These limits ensure the website to
              work properly for all users.

          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Why the conversion isn't it working?</strong>
            <p>
              There's a set limit for the number of requests to ensure smooth
              operation. If it's not working, you might have reached that limit.
              Just try again later or consider helping us with a donation to
              keep the app running. More about donations is explained below.

            <strong>How do i get good answers ?</strong>
            <p>
              For best results, provide a clear context. The model needs a
              working situation to analyze, not just random words. Define
              subjects and situations adequately. For example, think about the
              email you need to send or a future conversation with your boss.

            <strong>Can i use RageFormatter on mobile?</strong>
            <p>
              Absolutely! The web is responsive and you can use it in all type
              of devices. You might encounter small differences but the tool
              will work in the same way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Why do you need donations ?</strong>
            <p>
              Each time the model transforms your message there is an
              interaction with the OpenAI LLM, which means that we encounter a
              small cost. Even if the cost of a single call is small, the whole
              project needs to make a breakeven with revenues or it will stop.
